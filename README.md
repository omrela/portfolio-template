# Portfolio Template

Hey! I made this quick and simple portfolio template for friends that are new to programming and want a simple portfolio. I spun this project up during my lunch, so there might be some small issues within it. Feel free to tweak it and repurpose it however you would like!

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Instal dependencies & running local env

```
Using yarn

yarn install
yarn dev
```

```
Using npm

npm install
npm run dev
```

```
Using pnpm

pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

2. Navigate to `/src/app/data.ts`

Replace the placeholder data with your name, projects, etc. You can update the images used by importing them into the `/public` or directly linking image URLS that are hosted on 3rd party services. I have configured images.unsplash.com by default in the `next.config.js` file.

## Deployment

I highly recommend deploying this project via Vercel. It is quick and simple. They also have a very generous free tier.
